[MIT Autonomous Driving Project](https://github.com/mit-acl/mit-autonomous-driving) is a Programm for Undergraduate Research and Education at MIT. 
I have been working on this project for 12 weeks. 
[Certificate](static/mit_ad/mit_ad_finish_certi.pdf) and [Grades](/mit_ad/mit_ad_grades.pdf) are available to be access by anyone.

In this project, I have worked on the following topics:
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning

We use [Cityscape Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com) for training and testing. 
An architecture of U-net is used for training.
The illustration of the dataset can be shown below:
