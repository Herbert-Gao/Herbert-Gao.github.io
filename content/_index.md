          My research interests mainly focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning in the field of vehicle engineering. 
          I am also interested in embodied intelligence. 
          ROS (Robot Operating System) and RTOS (Real Time Operating System) are closely related to my past research and I have a solid foundation in these areas.
          I have a knowledge base of rule-based reasoning and knowledge representation in controlling, like classic PID, and modern-control like MPC, Robust control, RL.
          Furthermore, I am also familiar with the design of deep learning models. 
          More interesting things about me can be found in past researches, education background, and future plans.
          Some files may be unavailable yet, please mail to me at herbert_gao@outlook.com if you are interested.

        I prefer to challenge myself. I like trying new things. Security will be the next big thing with AI. I've been learning about it since 2020 and I want to make a difference. 
        I'm self-motivated and I learn quickly. For example, when there are needs for ROS, I learn about it and write a document for others to learn from. 
        I like to learn new things and use them in my research. I like sports and music. Books are good for solving problems. AI can help us searching in the limited time.

        This site has not been fully completed yet. I will update it later.
