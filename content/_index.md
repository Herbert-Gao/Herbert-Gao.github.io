          My research interests mainly focus on the application of machine learning and deep learning in the field of vehicle engineering. 
          I am also interested in the application of embodied intelligence. 
          ROS and RTOS are closely related to my past research and I have a solid foundation in these areas.
          More interesting things about me can be found in my [past researches](uploads/past_research.pdf), [education background](uploads/edu_background.pdf), and [future plans](uploads/future_plans.pdf).

        I would like to challenge myself.
        Jumping into different fields makes me feel excited.
        I think security will be the next hot topic after artificial intelligence.
        I am learning more about it ever since 2020 and I believe that I will make a difference in this field.
        
        I am a self-motivated person and a fast learner.
        I always try to learn something new in different fields and apply it to my research.
        Sports and music are my favorite things in life.
        
        When facing an unsolvable problem, books are always good helpers and AI will offer assistance.
